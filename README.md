### What is SoapsFloor?

SoapsFloor is a vertical falling dungeon plugin for Paper 1.21+. Players drop through floors, fight mobs on each level, and try to survive all the way to the bottom. Build your own dungeon rooms using WorldEdit schematics, configure mobs per floor, and let your players compete for the fastest completion time.

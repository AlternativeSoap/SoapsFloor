Welcome to the official SoapsFloor wiki. Everything you need to set up, configure, and run your own vertical dungeon on your Minecraft server.

### What is SoapsFloor?

SoapsFloor is a vertical falling dungeon plugin for Paper 1.21+. Players drop through floors, fight mobs on each level, and try to survive all the way to the bottom. Build your own dungeon rooms using WorldEdit/FAWE schematics, configure mobs per floor, and let your players compete for the fastest completion time.
